		<p> so i am here to judge   We see many animals. Some are wild and some are domestic. The cow is a domestic animal. Of all the domestic animals, the cow is the most useful. The cow has four legs. She has a long head with two eyes, two ears and two horns. She has a long tail with a tuft of hair at the end. She drives away flies and mosquitoes with her tail. She has one set of teeth in her lower jaw. Her body covered with short hair. She defends herself with the help of her horns. Her hoofs are divided. The cow is found almost everywhere in the world. Wild cows live in jungles. There are many kinds of cows. Some are big and some are small. The cows of cold countries are big some cows are black, some are red, some are big and some are of mixed colors. The cow is gentle and it does no harm to us. She gives birth to one calf at a time. She eats all day long and chews the cud. She loves her calf very much. The cow lives on grass. She eats straw, bran, and leaves of trees. It also eats oil cakes. The cow is very useful to us. Her milk is sweet and nutritious. Many kinds of sweets are made from milk bags and shoes are made of her hide. Buttons and combs are made of bones. Cow-dung is good manure. The cow does much good to us. So we should take of her.you and take you</p>
